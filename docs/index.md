# Objective Morality

Objective Morality is a Python project that provides a framework for analyzing ethical dilemmas from various philosophical perspectives. It's designed to be a tool for teaching and exploring the differences between philosophical ideas and how they relate to one another. By defining a "moral context" for a given action, you can see how different ethical engines would evaluate that action, providing a side-by-side comparison of their conclusions.

This project is intended for educational purposes, particularly in a university setting, to help students understand the practical application of ethical theories.

## Features

*   **Multiple Moral Engines:** The project includes implementations of several major ethical frameworks.
*   **Customizable Scenarios:** Define your own ethical dilemmas by creating simple JSON files.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** The output clearly shows the judgment of each philosophical engine.
*   **Consistency-Checking:** The system runs checks to highlight logical tensions between the verdicts of different engines.
*   **Typed and Extensible:** The codebase uses Python's type hinting and is designed to be easily extended.

## The Moral Engines

*   **Kantian Engine:** Evaluates actions based on the Categorical Imperative.
*   **Utilitarian Engine:** Focuses on the consequences of an action, judging it based on whether it produces the greatest good.
*   **Aristotelian Engine:** Assesses actions based on whether they align with a virtuous character.
*   **Contractualist Engine:** Judges actions based on whether they would be permitted by rules that free, equal, and rational people would agree to.
*   **Rossian Engine:** Balances multiple *prima facie* (self-evident) duties.
*   **Nietzschean Engine:** Analyzes actions based on whether they express a "will to power".
*   **Ethics of Care Engine:** Prioritizes the maintenance of relationships and the needs of specific, vulnerable individuals.
*   **Rawlsian Engine:** Evaluates actions from behind a "veil of ignorance".
